"<strong>UPDATE</strong> - 4.0+ is here, completely overhauled, yet again. As "
"always, <a href=\"http://tidythemes.com/concept/#upgrading\">use caution "
"when upgrading</a> (tidythemes.com/concept/#upgrading) and <a href=\"http:"
"//tidythemes.com/concept/\">learn the TidyThemes concept</a> (tidythemes."
"com/concept). &nbsp; &rarr; <em><strong>CAUTION</strong>: If you're child "
"theming or have clients that are child theming on top of BlankSlate (not the "
"recommended use), please do not blindly upgrade to newer versions.</em> "
"&nbsp; &rarr; <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: BlankSlate is the definitive "
"WordPress HTML5 boilerplate starter theme. We've carefully constructed the "
"most clean and minimalist theme available anywhere for designers/developers "
"to use as a base/foundation to build websites for clients or to build "
"completely custom themes from scratch to release faster. Clean, semi-"
"minified, unformatted and valid code, SEO-friendly, no programmer comments, "
"standardized and as white label as possible and most importantly, CSS reset "
"for cross-browser-compatability and no intrusive visual CSS styles added "
"whatsoever. A perfect skeleton theme that blows any others like it (the "
"subsequent underscores.me for example) completely out of the water, as "
"they're simply too overcomplicated for what people really want in this kind "
"of theme. Now comes with jQuery enqueued and ready to go. &nbsp; &rarr; "
"<strong>SUPPORT</strong>: Please use the <a href=\"http://tidythemes."
"com/forum/\">official support forum</a> (tidythemes.com/forum). Comments and "
"suggestions for improving BlankSlate, please see \"<a href=\"http:"
"//tidythemes.com/tidythemes-sucks/\">TidyThemes Sucks!</a>\" (tidythemes."
"com/tidythemes-sucks). Just getting started? <a href=\"http://tidythemes."
"com/want-to-learn-css/\">Want to learn CSS?</a> (tidythemes.com/want-to-"
"learn-css) &nbsp; &rarr; <strong>WHAT'S NEW?</strong>: We stripped down as "
"much custom, extraneous, superfluous junk code as we could and greatly "
"improved the HTML5 structure. <a href=\"http://make.wordpress."
"org/themes/author/chipbennett/\">Chip Bennett</a> (make.wordpress."
"org/themes/author/chipbennett), a highly experienced programmer and official "
"WordPress administrator, worked closely with us to audit the theme code for "
"quality. <a href=\"http://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?"
"old_path=/blankslate/3.3&amp;new_path=/blankslate/4.0\">See</a> (themes.trac."
"wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=/blankslate/3.3&amp;new_path=/blankslate/4."
"0) just how much we've revamped things. Last, but not least, BlankSlate has "
"now been <a href=\"https://github.com/tidythemes/blankslate\">opened up on "
"GitHub</a> (github.com/tidythemes/blankslate) if anyone would like to make "
"suggested code additions/improvements. Thank you for using BlankSlate."
